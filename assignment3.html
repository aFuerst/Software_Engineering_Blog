    The section on estimating project times was the most interesting and useful to me. Estimating how
    long a project can take has always eluded me and reading that it is hard even for experienced 
    developers is good to hear. The prototyping reminded me alot of a project I just did over the weekend 
    that made writing the whole thing much easier after we had drawn it up first.
